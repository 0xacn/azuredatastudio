Common examples in use now are Python, R, Scala, and Spark. The SQL kernel in Azure Data Studio is the first SQL Server kernel for a notebook.\r\n\r\nAzure Data Studio notebooks ship with SQL out of the box, and if the user chooses to install Python, they will also get Python, R, Scala, and PySpark. \r\n\r\nThe SQL kernel has been implemented using the functionality of the existing query editor. Other kernels use the industry standard Jupyter notebook server (embedded in Azure Data Studio).\r\n\r\n**Attach To**\r\n\r\nThis is the compute environment for the code - basically, where it will run. For SQL this is exactly analogous to the familiar Connection property of a query.\r\n\r\n**Cell**\r\n\r\nA cell is an editable section of the notebook. Cells can be human-readable text or code. Text cells are edited in the Markdown language to allow formatting and can include rich content including images. In Azure Data Studio, code cells include intellisense where possible.\r\n\r\n**Results**\r\n\r\nCode cells can be executed against the environment specified in Attach To, and their results are saved into the notebook. Once executed and saved, the results can be opened with the file without having be be re-executed. Results may be text, grids, charts, or other visualizations.\r\n\r\n**Trusted vs Non-Trusted**\r\n\r\nSince notebooks can contain HTML and Javascript code, it would be possible for a maliciously formed notebook to execute code simply upon being opened by the user. To prevent this, notebooks have the concept of \"Trusted\" and \"Untrusted.\" Untrusted HTML is sanitized and untrusted Javascript is not executed. Users can mark notebooks trusted if necessary, but in common use cases an untrusted notebook will perform the same as a trusted one. This is similar to the behavior of many other file types when downloaded from the internet.\r\n",
